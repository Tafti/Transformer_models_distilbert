# Transformer Practice

A concise README for a small repo containing three Jupyter notebooks focused on transformer practice and experiments.

## Project Overview
Short collection of notebooks demonstrating transformer concepts, experiments, and small reproducible examples. Intended for learning and incremental experimentation.

## Notebooks
Replace the placeholders below with actual filenames and short summaries (1–2 lines each) from your notebooks.

- notebook_1.ipynb — (e.g., data loading, preprocessing, or a primer on attention)
- notebook_2.ipynb — (e.g., model implementation or training a small transformer)
- notebook_3.ipynb — (e.g., evaluation, visualization, experiments, or ablation studies)

If you provide the exact filenames or paste the first markdown cell of each notebook, I will populate these summaries automatically.

## Quickstart
1. Clone the repo:
    git clone <repo-url>
2. Create environment and install dependencies:
    - With pip:
      python -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    - Or with conda:
      conda create -n transformers python=3.10
      conda activate transformers
      pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Launch Jupyter:
    jupyter lab
4. Open and run the notebooks in order.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- jupyterlab or notebook
- Typical ML stack: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, torch (or tensorflow), transformers (if used)
Add a requirements.txt with versions used in your environment for reproducibility.

## Structure
- notebooks/ — the three Jupyter notebooks
- data/ — (optional) datasets or links to data
- scripts/ — (optional) helper scripts for preprocessing or training
- README.md — this file
